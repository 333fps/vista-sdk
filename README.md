# Vista SDK

The Vista team at DNV are working on tooling related to
* DNV Vessel Information Structure (VIS)
* ISO 19847 - Ships and marine technology — Shipboard data servers to share field data at sea
* ISO 19848 - Ships and marine technology — Standard data for shipboard machinery and equipment

In this repository we codify the rules and principles of VIS and related ISO-standard,
to make adoption of these easier.
